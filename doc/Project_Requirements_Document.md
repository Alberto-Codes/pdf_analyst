# Project Requirements Document: MVP Scope, Features, and Objectives

## 1. MVP Scope
- **Data Extraction:**  
  Automatically extract structured information from SEC 10-K filings, focusing on key business metrics such as board composition, revenue figures, and employee statistics.

- **Traceability:**  
  Ensure that every piece of extracted information is clearly linked back to its original location within the source document. This allows users to verify and audit the data easily.

- **Auditability:**  
  Develop a process that records every step of the data extraction, creating a transparent workflow where all actions are logged and can be reviewed if needed.

## 2. Objectives
- **Automated Extraction:**  
  Build a system that can reliably and automatically identify and extract the necessary data from SEC 10-K filings without manual intervention.

- **Quality Assurance:**  
  Integrate validation processes to check the accuracy of the extracted data. Define clear success criteria (for example, achieving specific accuracy thresholds for different data points).

- **User-Friendly Output:**  
  Provide the extracted data in a structured and easy-to-understand format that allows users to quickly locate the source of each data point and understand its context.

- **Robust Error Management:**  
  Establish clear procedures for handling any errors during extraction, including logging issues and defining fallback or review processes for extraction failures.

## 3. Features
- **Automated Data Identification:**  
  Implement a mechanism to detect and extract key details (such as board members, revenue, and employee data) directly from the filings.

- **Structured Data Output:**  
  Organize the extracted information into a clear and consistent format (e.g., tabular data) that supports further analysis and reporting.

- **Source Linkage (Traceability):**  
  Each extracted data point should include metadata—such as the document section or page number—so that users can easily verify its origin.

- **Comprehensive Logging and Audit Trails:**  
  Maintain a detailed record of each step in the extraction process to ensure transparency and support compliance checks.

- **Built-In Error Handling:**  
  Design the process with integrated checks to identify and manage extraction errors, ensuring that any issues are clearly recorded and resolved.
